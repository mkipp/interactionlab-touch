# Interaction Lab / Touch

Processing/Android programs that showcase multitouch interaction techniques.
These programs are being developed for the Interaction Lab at Augsburg University
of Applied Sciences.

## Rotate, Scale, Translate

## Target Acquisition

This topic is concerned with mouse interaction and the question how
to select a target fast and accurately.
